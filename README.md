# Complex-SQL-Practice-for-Interview
I have tried to solve some complex SQL interview questions that had been asked in several company. Collected this question from Ankit Bansal. He made a organized playlist along with the solution. I have tried to figure out them first and then checked whether my query is correct or no. Thanks in advance.
